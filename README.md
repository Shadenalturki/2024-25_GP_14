# SummAIze

## Introduction
SummAIze is an artificial intelligence (AI) Android application that simplifies the learning process by providing summaries of lecture slides, translating the summaries into Arabic, creating quizzes based on those summaries, and offering a chatbot for personalized tutoring. By reducing and clarifying complex material, it aims to increase student accessibility and learning effectiveness.

## Technology
SummAIze is built using Python as the primary programming language. It leverages Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) to provide relevant summaries, utilizes Large Language Models (LLMs) to create context-aware responses and summaries, integrates LangChain for chaining different language tasks, and makes use of NLP (Natural Language Processing) models from Hugging Face for translation and text processing tasks.
